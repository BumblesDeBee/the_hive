    <h1>Welcome to the Home Sweet</h1> (as honey) <h1>Hive of Bumbles de Bee!</h1>
    <h2>***Builder of All Things Web***</h2>

    <p>
        This page will act as an ever evolving guidebook, inviting you to join me as I buzz and bumble about, on an epic
        quest to discover (and hopefully avoid getting caught in) the world of THE WEB.
    </p>

    <p>Here I'll post all of my original work/personal projects (as in self-directed - not part of a
        tutorial/assignment/etc) - updated regularly (in real time???)
    </p>

    <p>Currently, I'm unsure of how I'm going to organize this Hive Page, however, what I do plan on is to start
        building a variety of websites with my (at the time of this writing) rudimentary skill set and, rather than
        "finish" them as basic sites and moving onto new projects as I learn, I will continue building upon these
        original web projects, allowing them to evolve and grow alongside me on my journey :)</p>

    <p>
        That said, I certainly intend on documenting my learning and building process (and progress), along the way.
        This Hive - my web design/development journal and portfolio - will be as much a historical document as it is a
        living entity!
    </p>
